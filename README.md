# Bored Dragon in a Cave

This is just a simple proof-of-concept 2d game that I made on a sunday with [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) just because it bothered me that I had not made any videogame before, not even small one. I know it's pretty rough and the code is a mess (duplicated code, inconsistent structure, way too many global variables…), but this was just a quick project.
